Once CalyxOS is installed on the device, it will receive frequent Over-The-Air (OTA) updates directly from our servers automatically.

## OS updates

The device automatically checks for, downloads and install updates.

A reboot is required to finish updating, you will get a notification for that.

Updates are typically done monthly, following Android Open Source Project security releases.

You can check for updates and control update settings from **Settings -> System -> Updates**.

A changelog can also be viewed there, or by tapping the update notification.

### Manual installation

If you'd like to manually update your CalyxOS install, see [[ota]].

### Security patch level

Google releases monthly security updates for Android, which contain important fixes.

CalyxOS takes those and integrates them into the OS, and releases new builds.

They can be divided into multiple parts, as each of them has to be updated separately.

Open source:
* Platform - AOSP, the open source components that CalyxOS builds on.
* Kernel - Android's fork of the Linux kernel.

Proprietary:
* Vendor - the proprietary components needed to make a device work.
* Firmware / bootloader - more of the above

## App updates

Some of the apps included with CalyxOS are updated via F-Droid.

You can check for updates by opening F-Droid and pulling down to refresh.

This will show any available updates in the Updates tab.
