    other XMPP server as well. A lot of XMPP servers are run by volunteers and are
    free of charge.</p><p>XMPP Features:</p><p>Conversations works with every XMPP
    server out there. However XMPP is an extensible protocol. These extensions are
    standardized as well in so called XEP’s. Conversations supports a couple of those
    to make the overall user experience better. There is a chance that your current
    XMPP server does not support these extensions. Therefore to get the most out of
    Conversations you should consider either switching to an XMPP server that does
    or - even better - run your own XMPP server for you and your friends.</p><p>These
    XEPs are - as of now:</p><ul><li> XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams (or mod_proxy65).
    Will be used to transfer files if both parties are behind a firewall (NAT).</li><li>
    XEP-0163: Personal Eventing Protocol for avatars</li><li> XEP-0191: Blocking command
    lets you blacklist spammers or block contacts without removing them from your
    roster.</li><li> XEP-0198: Stream Management allows XMPP to survive small network
    outages and changes of the underlying TCP connection.</li><li> XEP-0280: Message
    Carbons which automatically syncs the messages you send to your desktop client
    and thus allows you to switch seamlessly from your mobile client to your desktop
    client and back within one conversation.</li><li> XEP-0237: Roster Versioning

    Scrambled Exif (pronounced <i>egg</i>sif) helps you remove the metadata in your pictures before you share them.

    If you feel like it.

    If you don't want the big Internet companies (or whomever) to know where your pictures were taken don't forget to remove the metadata from them before you share them.

    To remove the metadata from a picture, simply share it like you'd normally do and choose <i>Scrambled Exif</i>. A moment later, the share 'dialog' will reappear. Now just share with the app you intended to share with in the first place.

    Et voilà!

    <b>Required Android Permissions:</b>

    ★ READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to read the images other apps share with it.

    <b>Source Code</b>

    ★ This app is open source. You can take a look at the code (and contribute if you feel like it) here:

    https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif

    <b>Translations</b>

    If you wish to help to translate this app to your own language, you can do so using transifex:

    https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/

    <b>Misc Stuff and Facts</b>

    ★ Basically, Exif is used by jpeg, which is the format in which your Android camera saves pictures. If you want to know more about Exif, check the Wikipedia.

    ★ Scrambled Exif also renames the files (this can be disabled).

    ★ Please don't heavily rely on the data being deleted. Scrambled Exif does its job pretty well, but it could fail. Always double-check before you share.

    ★ It doesn't really <i>scramble</i> the Exif data, it deletes it. So the name is probably stupid. But I like it. The icon doesn't depict scrambled eggs either. So the icon is probably stupid. But I like it. And I also happen to be a huge fan of eggs. So this app doesn't only have a stupid name and an equally stupid icon, it is also my (non-stupid) tribute to eggs. Especially <i>huevos fritos</i>. Because I love them.

    ★ Have fun sharing your pics!
